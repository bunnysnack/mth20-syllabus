      PCC is committed to supporting all students. If you plan to use academic accommodations for this course, please contact your instructor as soon as possible to 
      discuss your needs. Accommodations are not retroactive; they begin when the instructor receives the “Approved Academic Accommodations” letter from you 
      (submitted in person for courses on campus; via email for Online Learning courses). To request academic accommodations for a disability, please contact an 
      Accessible Education and Disability Resources counselor on any PCC campus. 
      Office locations, phone numbers, and additional information may be located on the
