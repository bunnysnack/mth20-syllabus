  <introduction>
    <p>
      I highly encourage you to exchange information with your peers, 
      especially those you are working with in groups, to work together outside
      of class. Email, group chats, and Discord servers are all excellent ways
      to connect and collaborate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best way to contact me is through email. I check my email often! 
      please email me at <email>miranda.ramsey@pcc.edu</email>. <alert>We must 
      use your PCC email address to communicate</alert> according to federal
      law, so make sure you are contacting me from your PCC email address or 
      the D2L Classlist feature, and checking your PCC email regularly for my
      replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emails sent on weekdays will be answered within 24 hours. Emails sent
      over a weekend or holiday will be answered the following scheduled school
      day.
