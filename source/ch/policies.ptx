    <title>Student Rights and Responsibilities</title>
    <introduction>
    <p>
      Students are required to complete this course in accordance with the 
      <url href="https://www.pcc.edu/policy/student-rights/" visual="https://www.pcc.edu/policy/student-rights/">
      Student Rights and Responsibilities Handbook.</url> The Handbook 
      establishes students' freedoms and protections as well as the 
      expectations of appropriate behavior and ethical academic work. The 
      Handbook includes items such as the Policy on Student Rights, and the 
      Student Code of Conduct Policy and Procedures.
    </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-academic-integrity">
      <title>Academic Integrity</title>
      <p>
        The handbook contains the Code of Student Conduct and the Academic 
        Integrity Policy. <term>Cheating</term> includes any attempt to 
        defraud, deceive, or mislead the instructor in arriving at an honest 
        grade assessment, and may include copying answers from other students 
        or using unauthorized notes during tests. <term>Plagiarism</term> is a 
        particular form of cheating that involves presenting as one's own the 
        ideas or work of another and may include using other people's ideas 
        without proper attribution and submitting another person's work as 
        one's own. Dishonest activities such as cheating on exams and 
        submitting or copying work donw by others will result in disciplinary 
        actions including but not limited to receiving a failing grade. For 
        further information, review the institution's 
        <url href="https://www.pcc.edu/student-conduct/conduct/academic-integrity-at-pcc/" visual="https://www.pcc.edu/student-conduct/conduct/academic-integrity-at-pcc/"> 
        Academic Integrity Policy.</url>

    <subsubsection xml:id="ai-statement">
      <title>Artificial Intelligence Statement</title>

      <p>
        The use of generative AI and Language Learning Models in this course 
        such as, but not limited to ChatGPT, should be used only if it does not 
        otherwise violate the Academic Integrity Policy of the College. Such 
        violations include turning in work that is not your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this class specifically, while generative AI and language learning 
        models can be excellent tools for summarizing and presenting 
        information, leaning on such tools when you are yourself trying to 
        learn something, even in ways that seem to be academically honest, can 
        instill a dependency that is really challenging to let go of later. 
        <alert>I highly recommend avoiding the use of tools like ChatGPT, even 
        as a study assistant!</alert> Please ask me for help instead.

      Our course is typically unaffected by college campus and facility 
      closures or delayed class start times. Our regular due dates [and Zoom 
      class meeting times (if a remote class)] apply. However, if PCC must 
      close all operations, our regular due dates will be adjusted accordingly.
