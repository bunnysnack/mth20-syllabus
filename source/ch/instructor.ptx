    <title>Instructional Approach</title>
    <p>
      Mathematics has an unfortunate reputation for being a challenging subject that only some people are capable of engaging with. I strongly believe that this is not true, and that more people are capable of mathematics than we give credit to. My goal is to facilitate creativity and discovery, rather than simply dictating facts and procedures to memorize. In my lectures I set out to establish a question that can ground us and give us context for the math we are working with, and through group work students will be encouraged to talk through problems, ask for help, and lift each other up.
