  <title>Weekly Structure</title>
  <p>
    Each week we will be covering material from the textbook at a pace of about one chapter per week. Homework for each week will be due the following Monday, and quizzes and exams will be administered on Wednesdays.
  </p>
  <p>
    To perform best in the class, each week you should:
    <dl>
      <li>
        <title>Read Ahead</title>
        <p>
          Read the textbook material ahead of the days we will be covering it in class, so that you can ask questions and get clarification during lectures and group work.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Do Homework As We Go</title>
        <p>
          Work on the homework throughout the week, rather than waiting until the end of the week. This way, challenging problems can be brought up in class with me or with your group.

      <li>
        <title>Come to Office Hours</title>
        <p>
          Visit me in Office Hours to fill in gaps in your understanding, before they become stressful issues.
