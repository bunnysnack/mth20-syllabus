  <title>AI Statement</title>

  <p>
    The use of generative AI in this course such as, but not limited to ChatGPT, should be used only if it does not otherwise 
    violate the Academic Integrity Policy of the College. Such violations include turning in work that is not your own.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this class specifically, while generative AI and language learning models can be excellent tools for summarizing and 
    presenting information, leaning on such tools when you are yourself trying to learn something, even in ways that seem to 
    be academically honest, can instill a dependency that is really challenging to let go of later. <alert>I highly recommend avoiding 
    the use of tools like ChatGPT, even as a study assistant!</alert> Please ask me for help instead.
